				<h2>Symphony’s Concert on the Lawn – Fun for the Family!</h2>
				
				<p><em>July 21, 2016</em>
					
				<p>On August 6, 2016 at 7:00 p.m. US Bank Home Mortgage will present Concert on the Lawn. A fun-filled night with the Owensboro Symphony featuring <strong>Randy Lanham, Annabelle Watts, Chris Joslin, and Tom Ewing!</strong></p>

				<p>This free family-friendly event will be a celebration of All Things Kentucky! Bluegrass, Bar-B-Que, and a little bit of Banjo will be prominent throughout the evening.</p>

				<p>Concert goers are encouraged to pack a picnic, put on comfortable clothes, grab their lawn chairs and blankets and head to the lawn at Kentucky Wesleyan College for this FREE community event. Tables and chairs for eight may be reserved for $100 in advance by calling 270-684-0661. Those who reserve tables often participate in the table decorating contest. Those who do participate are encouraged to decorate their tables reflecting the evenings theme – All Things Kentucky! A winner will be chosen to receive a complimentary table for White on Second, the OSO’s annual fundraiser, which takes place on Second St. in front of the Academy on September 17.</p>

				<p><strong>NEW THIS YEAR TO CONCERT ON THE LAWN…</strong> a Kentucky Buffet will be available prior to the concert for all patrons – with advance reservations! Patrons can feed their friends and family in their own picnic spot or at their table. The Kentucky Buffet will include Bourbon Glazed Pork Tenderloin, Homestyle Vegetables, Fruit Cobblers and Tea and Lemonade. Buffet tickets are $15.00 per person and must be purchased in advance by calling 270-684-0661, extension 11.
