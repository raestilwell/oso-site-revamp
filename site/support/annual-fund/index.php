				<h2>Thank You</h2>
				<p>Thank you for your support of the Owensboro Symphony Orchestra! We hope you’ll take a moment to consider making a tax-deductible donation towards preserving the musical programs offered by the Owensboro Symphony.</p>

				<p>The Symphony works towards providing Owensboro with a rich cultural flavor, and the Owensboro Symphony needs the support of its patrons to continue with this goal. For more information on helping the OSO build a better community, please call (270) 684-0661 ext. 15 or <a href="mailto:gwyn@theoso.com">gwyn@theoso.com.</a> Our supporters receive special gifts and benefits as a way of saying “thank you!”</p>

				<p>Proceeds from ticket revenues account for less than 40% of the Owensboro Symphony Orchestra’s annual operating budget. The remainder is generously provided by corporations, foundations, government agencies, and individuals like you! Your gift to the Annual Fund will help ensure that the OSO continues to perform with the highest standards of quality and artistic integrity. Contributions also support our extensive youth and education programs and the training of tomorrow’s musicians through the OSO Youth Orchestras. Your gift will help continue this legendary tradition of excellence.</p>
