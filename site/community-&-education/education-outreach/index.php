				<h3>Bring the Symphony to your Classroom</h3>
				<p><strong>Where the Wild Things Are</strong> – in your school to a single classroom or more. Bring this modern classic to life through music, featuring your K-3 students as the primary characters in the story!</p>

				<p>The children create music, actually perform their music, and respond to this modern classic story. With the help of a few simple props, musical instruments, and your students’ creativity, <em>Cathy Mullins</em>, Kindermusik instructor, will bring a fantastic mini-production for your school or next family night.</p>

 

				<p><strong>Symphony Story Time</strong> – schedule a half hour in your preschool to have one of our OSO musicians come and play an instrument and talk about music. We couple this with a reader (someone from your school, or we can provide one) to present a children’s book. A delightful way to introduce young children to wonderful music!</p>

 

				<p><strong>Symphony Live! <em>[Outside Daviess County]</em></strong> - This program has now been adjusted to be age-appropriate for primary grades. This has the “instrument zoo” component that comes to your school!</p>

				<p>We not only cover the basics—families of the orchestra, how the instruments make their sounds, but also the role of the conductor and much more! Children actively participate throughout the show, actually handling and/or playing orchestral instruments. This program is particularly useful for 4th and 5th graders as they anticipate joining band or orchestra—but also works well with primary grades.</p>

				<p>A teacher in Henderson said, “Very informative and appropriate for our students. They were engaged and [the presenter] interacted well with them.” This has been particularly effective for schools who are some distance from the RiverPark Center.</p>

 

				<p><strong>Strings Attached</strong> — Carrie Olsen is our Strings Attached instructor. She will engage your students as they are introduced to the violin! Carrie will visit your 4th (city) or 5th (county) graders for two days with 32 half-size violins. They spend two periods getting hands-on violin instruction.</p>

 

				<p><strong>Symphony Safari</strong> —“The Symphony Safari tickets give an opportunity to families who otherwise would not be able to attend the symphony.” Students, their families, and your teaching staff get to attend a Saturday night OSO Masterworks Series concert at NO CHARGE. We can adjust to your particular educational needs – with a visit to the school ahead of time to prepare the children (materials provided to teachers for preparation and follow-up). We can also accommodate buses, should you desire.</p>

 

				<p><strong>Respect Your Friends and Teachers!</strong> —The OSO musicians come to your school to bring not only great music but important social concepts as well. One music specialist wrote of “…the wonderful interaction the professionals had with the elementary students. They spoke at the appropriate level and made the program light and upbeat.”</p>

				<p>We’ll bring them to your school and put them in an intimate performance setting where your students are within arms-reach of the ensembleThe musicians will demonstrate that respectful speech and conduct are essential to success in music and all aspects of their lives!</p>

 

				<p><strong>Lobby concerts</strong> – At RiverPark Center! These feature your student groups (instrumental or choral) performing in the lobby prior to the OSO concerts (or even at intermission). They offer your group invaluable experience in front of an appreciative audience in a professional setting. We’ve had the privilege of having elementary, middle and high school groups! Inquire if interested!</p>

 

				<p><strong>Meet the Maestro</strong> - Maestro Nick Palmer will visit your classroom! During a Meet the Maestro program at your school, he can read a book to your students, or the children can speak with the OSO’s star performer on whatever topic you choose.</p>
